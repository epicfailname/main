== Introduction

README is an integrated bookmark manager and feed reader desktop application
that helps you read more content you care about anywhere you go.

You'll love README if you consume a lot of web content and want to keep up to date with your favourite websites but you're a road warrior who doesn't have regular Internet access.

Whether you're heading off on a long flight or working in a cafe, README has you covered with all the content you care about in one place.

README is for those who *prefer to use a desktop app for subscribing to web feeds and saving web pages to read later on their personal computer*.

More importantly, README is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

If you can type fast, README can make you more efficient at consuming content than traditional GUI apps.

Jump to <<Quick Start>> to get started!

=== Overview

==== Link Saving and Management - Read Anything
README helps you capture the content that you discover online.

Save the latest news stories, magazine articles, recipes, how-tos – anything you discover online.
Whenever you find a web page you want to read later, add it to your reading list in README.
To help you organize the mountain of content, README lets you tag link so you can always find what you're looking for,
and archive or delete links you've finished reading so your reading list won't become cluttered.

==== Web Feeds Subscription - Read More
README keeps you up to date with your favourite websites.

Integrations with Bing Web Search and Google News mean you'll never run out of things to read.
Search for particular topics you'd like to know more about or just read the top news stories - it's up to you.
As README also functions as a feed reader, you can subscribe and unsubscribe from any RSS or Atom feed available on the Internet.
Whenever you open README, the latest content from your subscribed feeds is automatically added to your reading list.

==== Offline Support - Read Anywhere
README lets you read offline, even on airplanes, trains, or on Wi-Fi-only devices away from Internet connections.

Whenever you save a link, README automatically downloads its web page to your personal computer if there is an Internet connection.
This gives you the convenience of viewing your saved links anywhere, anytime, even if there is no Internet connection.
If you still want to keep a link but no longer need to view it offline, you can archive it.
This will delete its downloaded web page from your personal computer.

==== Reader View - Read Better
README makes your long reading sessions so much more comfortable.

Reader View strips out all the visual clutter from web pages and presents content in a perfectly formatted, clean layout,
so you can focus on the content without any unnecessary distractions.
You can even choose the colour scheme that suits you best -
try the white or sepia style if you're reading in a lighted environment, or the dark or black styles in a dark environment.
